# 🩺 **Diseases and Syndromes Extraction from UMLS**

## 🔍 **Overview**
> The **Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)** facilitates the development of computer systems that "understand" the language of biomedicine and health.  
This repository focuses on extracting and analyzing **diseases and syndromes** from UMLS datasets, leveraging its semantic types and relationships.
